# 📘 Student Management System – Assignment 3
A Java console-based application that demonstrates exception handling, multithreading, wrapper classes, and input validation. This implementation follows the exact requirements from the assignment document.

## 🚀 Features
### ✔ Input Validation
Checks for empty name, email, course
Ensures marks are between 0 and 100
Handles incorrect numeric input using try-catch
### ✔ Exception Handling

Integer for roll number
Double for marks
Demonstrates autoboxing and data conversion
### ✔ Student Record Management
Add a student
Store using HashMap
Display student details
Validate input
Auto-calculate grade
